# SwarmalatorSim
 
This repository contains the supplementary material for "Swarmalators: Oscillators that sync and swarm", the final project developed for the Control of Complex Systems and Networks exam. 

## MATLAB Code
The folder SwarmalatorSim contains the MATLAB code to simulate the system. It included pre-built simulation scenarios and utility functions for plotting and analysis.

## Supplementary videos
In the following, the supplementary videos for the project are presented:
